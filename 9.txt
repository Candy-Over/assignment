Indexing & Query Optimization
You have a table with millions of records, and the following query is running very slowly:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```

===========================Answer===============================

To solve this problem we will crete index with attributes status and created_at
code:

CREATE INDEX status_created_at ON orders (status, created_at DESC);
