Session Management & Performance
How would you manage PHP sessions for a high-traffic website with multiple web servers?

===========================Answer===============================

To handle session management in a high-traffic website with multiple web servers, using Redis is an efficient
solution due to its speed and in-memory storage. Although I haven't had the chance to use Redis yet, I am aware that it can store
sessions centrally, ensuring all servers share the same session data.
Another approach is storing sessions in a database, similar to how Laravel manages sessions, ensuring data persistence across
multiple servers.
