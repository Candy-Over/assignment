10. Data Integrity & Transactions
Explain why and how you would use transactions in PHP and MySQL when handling an e-commerce order process that involves multiple 
related database inserts (e.g., order, order_items, payments).

===========================Answer===============================

Transactions help keep data safe and clean, here are some following way how it does:
1. Making sure all related actions either pass together or fail together.  
2. Avoiding situations where some data gets saved and some doesnâ€™t if something goes wrong.  
3. Managing tricky stuff like placing an order, adding items to that order, and handling payments smoothly 
   without messing things up.

Suppose we want to place an order, and it will be successful if and only if the following steps are completed:
1. Order details are saved.
2. Each item is added to the order.
3. Payment is processed.

If any step fails like payment fails, all changes are rolled back, ensuring no incomplete data is saved.
